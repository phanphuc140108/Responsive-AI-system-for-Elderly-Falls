## BACKGROUND
______________
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 37 million falls requiring medical intervention occur each year worldwide.

- Falls are the leading cause of serious injuries and unintentional death among adults over 65.

- Hospitals and elderly-care facilities often lack the manpower to monitor vulnerable patients continuously.

- Without timely assistance, even a minor fall can escalate into severe or life-threatening complications.
