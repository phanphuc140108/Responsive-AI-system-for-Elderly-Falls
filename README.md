## 1. BACKGROUND

- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 37 million falls requiring medical intervention occur each year worldwide.

- Falls are the leading cause of serious injuries and unintentional death among adults over 65.

- Hospitals and elderly-care facilities often lack the manpower to monitor vulnerable patients continuously.

- Without timely assistance, even a minor fall can escalate into severe or life-threatening complications.

## 2. PROPOSED SOLUTION
A lightweight, camera-based monitoring system.

### General Workflow: Camera data → Pose estimation → Severity evaluation → Appropriate response.

### The system focuses on:

- Real-time posture monitoring.

- Detecting rapid/sudden changes in body position.

- Triggering a responsive alert when a fall is detected.

## 3. REQUIREMENTS

### Check the main requirements file at [REQUIREMENTS](https://github.com/phanphuc140108/Responsive-AI-system-for-Elderly-Falls/blob/main/requirements.txt)
### These are the general ones:

- Works reliably with predefined camera setups.

- Real-time processing & scalable.

- Low cost, easy to deploy, minimal hardware requirements.

## 4. SYSTEM LOGIC

### Pose Tracking:

- A camera captures the user’s movements.

- Using MediaPipe pose landmarks, the system extracts keypoints in real time.

- The body center is estimated from hip keypoints.

### Coordinate System:

- Top-down screen coordinates.

- Y increases downward.

### Fall Detection Mechanism:

- A fall typically causes the body to drop quickly → which shows up as a sudden increase in y_center on screen.

- The system:

  + Tracks y_center every frame.
  + Checks for rapid vertical displacement.
  + Verifies whether the drop is significant + persists for a few frames.
  + If conditions match → Trigger alert.

## -> No training required. Pure logic + keypoint data.

## 5. TECH STACK

- Python.

- OpenCV.

- MediaPipe Pose.

- Real-time video processing.

- Gmail API Integration + smtplib (Python).

## 6. APPLICATIONS
### In Private Homes:

- Ideal for elderly or disabled individuals living alone.

- Automatically detects falls and sends immediate alerts to family members or caregivers.

- Provides peace of mind and ensures timely intervention.

### In Public / Healthcare:

- Hospitals, nursing homes, shopping malls, train stations, etc.

- Monitors high-risk or crowded areas.

- Detects falls in real time and notifies staff/security.

- Helps reduce response time and prevent severe injuries.

## 7. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- Add SMS/IoT alert module.

- Multi-camera tracking.

- Activity classification model (TRAINING).

- Smoothing filters for more stable pose tracking.

- Edge-device deployment (Jetson Nano / Raspberry Pi).
