1. Background

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 37 million falls requiring medical intervention occur each year worldwide.

Falls are the leading cause of serious injuries and unintentional death among adults over 65.

Hospitals and elderly-care facilities often lack the manpower to monitor vulnerable patients continuously.

Without timely assistance, even a minor fall can escalate into severe or life-threatening complications.
